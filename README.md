# Simon-Game
Using jQuery 


The webapp has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the lighting up one button in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.
